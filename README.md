# testerHomeTasks
This project includes a series of testing homework assignments that I am completing as part of a software testing course. I plan to add more assignments as the course progresses.
I used testing fundamentals when creating test cases and checklists, but at that time I had no experience in domain testing or other test design methods. I realize the importance of this aspect and plan to improve my documents in the future taking into account the specifics of the domain.
